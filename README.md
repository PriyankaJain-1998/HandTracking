This repository involves beginner level computer vision project - Hand Tracking.

To run the repository, just clone the repo and run main.py file. 
This repository is a good start for computer vision related projects. It is implemented using Google's MediaPipe.
 - MediaPipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video, audio, etc. This cross-platform Framework works on Desktop/Server,   Android, iOS, and embedded devices like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano.
For hand tracking it has been trained on thousands of images including full hand and just palm images to make it more accurate.
